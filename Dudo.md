# Dudo #

Dudo (Spanish for I doubt), also known as Cacho, Pico, Perudo or Cachito is popular dice game played in Peru, Chile, Bolivia and other Latin American countries. It is a more specific version of a family of games collectively called Liar's Dice, which has many forms and variants. This game can be played by two or more players and consists of guessing how many dice, placed under cups, there are on the table showing a certain number. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last
player to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner.


## Game ##
Each player starts having five dice and a cup (or Dudo android app), which is used for shaking the dice and concealing your dice from the other players. Players roll die in order, to determine where and in what order they sit. Highest first, then next lowest and so on. In the event of a tie between 2 players, they simply re-roll until one gains a higher score. After deciding who starts the game (this can be done by
making each player roll one die, for example), the players shake their dice in their cups, and then each player looks at his or her own dice, but keeps these dice concealed from the other players. Then, the first player says how many dice are showing - at a minimum - a certain number (for example, "five threes", meaning there are at least 5 die showing a three, which can be fact or fictional) and tells the next player (play ALWAYS moves clockwise) to raise, call or spot on the announcement.

### Raise ###
If the player wants to increase, he/she increases the number of dice (e.g. from "five threes" to "six threes") or the die number (e.g. "five threes" to "five sixes") or both.

### Call ###
If the player calls, it means that they do not buy or believe the correctness of the previous call. The dice are shown and, if the guess is not correct (i.e. there are less than the number of die showing the number called - as in the example above, only 4 dice show threes), the previous player (who made the call) loses a die. If it's correct, the player who doubted loses a die. After calling a new round starts with the player that lost a die making a new initial call of their choice. The game continues until one player remains with dice.

### Spot On ###
If he/she calls spot on, this means that the player is sure that the previous announcement is the exact guess, so the number of dice, and the face value called will be exactly correct when all are revealed. The dice are shown. If the guess was correct, the match is canceled, nobody lose dice and the match restart from the player who made the declaration. If not, the player loses a die and puts it in the bag.

## The Aces ##
In Dudo, the aces (dice showing one) are wild. When checking the dice, aces are counted as the dice that were announced (e.g. If the final announcement is "three twos", the aces are counted as twos).
The aces have special rules when increasing. You can decrease a number to ace by dividing the quantity of dice by two, rounding up if it's necessary. For example, "six twos" can be transformed into "three aces" and "eleven fives" into "six aces" (11/2 = 5.5, then, 6). Also, you can increase aces, but this is performed by doubling and adding one to the quantity of dice. Example: "Four aces" is transformed into "Nine (anything)" (2\*4 + 1 = 9) or "two aces" are "5 (anything)" (2\*2 + 1 = 5).
Obviously, you can increase "three aces" into "four aces" as normally. It is not possiple declare aces as first declaration.

## Obliging rounds ##
When a player that had two dice loses one, an "obliging" round is made. Obviously, this player will start the round because of losing a die. (Note: Each player can "oblige" only once during the whole game.
The obliging round is not applicable if there are only two players.
The rules in these rounds are different.

  1. The aces don't count as jokers;
  1. When increasing, the die number may not be changed (i.e. "two fours" can't be increased to "two sixes"). _EXCEPTION: A player with only one die left can change also the dice value._

Have Fun!
